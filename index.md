## **Intro**
Holla guys! Welcome to my portfolio projects website!ðŸ˜ƒ

My name is Tito Dwi Syahputra, and you can call me Tito. I am a Data Enthusiast, currently looking for a full-time job in Data Science. I have a Bachelor of Science Degree majoring in Physics from Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia. I have completed some courses, finished some Virtual Internship Experiences & Virtual Job Simulation Programs, and also completed some projects to sharpen and enhance my knowledges and skills related to Data Science.

## **Projects**
### **Exploring Customer Experience with British Airways** | [Repository](https://github.com/dstito/Exploring-Customer-Experience-and-Predicting-Customer-Booking-Behaviour/tree/main) | [PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-EPG0HIlWdc2jh0q8QjfmvrSY9bJp1u0xmGM26Phvj0/edit?usp=sharing) 
- *Part of Project in British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage*
- **Background**:
   - Customers who book flights with British Airways will experience many interaction points with the brand.
   - Understanding customers' feelings, needs, and feedbacks are crucial for the business, such as maintaining consistently quality standards, and enhancing product and service quality to meet the customer needs and expectations.
   - This can be approached by exploring British Airways customer reviews and  conducting Topic Modeling with Machine Learning on the reviews.
- **Objectives**:
   - Collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source.
   - Analyzing the data to present any insights we may uncover.
   - Conducting Topic Modeling to know what topics are mainly discussed on reviews

### **Predicting Customer Booking Behavior with British Airways** | [Repository](https://github.com/dstito/Exploring-Customer-Experience-and-Predicting-Customer-Booking-Behaviour/tree/main) | [PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pXEfyHdQfBVH0e-u-vuDZBDHJGHo-gCAMOchu9k7yo8/edit?usp=sharing) 
- *Part of Project in British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage*
- **Background**:
   - British Airways has a problem where there is only 15% of customers completing their bookings, which lead to inefficient use of resources.
   - They need to predict whether the customers will complete their bookings or not, so that they can perform efficient resource allocation, and make more profit.
- **Objectives**:
   - Building a robust machine learning model to predict customers booking behaviour.
